# ü™®üìÑ‚úÇÔ∏èü¶éüññ Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock: The Big Bang Theory Edition

Bazinga! Welcome to the most intellectually stimulating and paradoxically complex-yet-simple game this side of Pasadena! This isn't your average Rock Paper Scissors ‚Äì it's the game that broke the Internet and The Big Bang Theory's apartment 4A!

## What's the deal with this game? (Imagine Sheldon asking)

This Next.js application brings you the game that Sheldon Cooper would approve of (if he approved of anything not invented by himself). It's Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, where (As Dr. Sheldon Cooper would say):

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- Rock crushes Scissors

## Why should you care? (Howard Wolowitz voice)

1. **It's better than Leonard's experiments**: This game is more exciting than any of Leonard's laser-based experiments.
2. **It's Sheldon-approved**: Well, in the show at least. Our Sheldon AI is still pending approval.
3. **It's a lesson in game theory**: Each choice wins 20% of the time. That's more reliable than Wolowitz's dating techniques!
4. **It's built with Next.js and TypeScript**: Because even Sheldon would agree that static typing is superior.
5. **It's famous**: Where else can you find a game that's been played in space (thanks to Howard) and in every corner of the CalTech cafeteria?

## How to Play (Easy enough for even Penny!)

1. Clone this repository (or don't, and risk Sheldon giving you a strike)
2. Run `npm install` (make sure you have Node.js installed, preferably a version that wouldn't make Sheldon scoff)
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (No, Sheldon, it's not a real locality)
5. Or just save yourself some time and go here : `https://rock-paper-scissor-lizard-spock-jtozust63-aj-shivalis-projects.vercel.app/`
6. Choose your weapon wisely, for the fate of the universe (and your seat on the couch) hangs in the balance

## Features (As explained by Raj Koothrappali)

- **Cutting-edge randomness**: We use a random number generator that's more unpredictable than Sheldon with a caffeine buzz.
- **Responsive design**: Play on your phone, tablet, or the screen of the Mars Rover (Howard says hi!).
- **Endless replayability**: With five options, it's like having five different Thai places to order from!
- **Educational value**: Learn about basic weapon superiority, reptile behavior, and Vulcan culture. It's like a fun episode of Star Trek!

## The Intellectual Bit (Bernadette's biochemistry lesson)

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, much like a complex protein structure, is an extension of a simpler system. It was designed to reduce the probability of a tie from 33.33% (in classic Rock Paper Scissors) to 20%.

The game was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, but it was popularized faster than Sheldon's attempts to make "Bazinga!" a thing, thanks to The Big Bang Theory.

In terms of probability, each choice has a 20% chance of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent. This creates a more complex strategic landscape than the original game, while still maintaining perfect balance ‚Äì something even Leonard and Penny's relationship struggled to achieve!

## Contribute (Amy Farrah Fowler's call for peer review)

Feel free to contribute to this project. Whether you want to add a "Soft Kitty" background music or implement an actual AI that plays like Sheldon, we're open to all ideas. Just open a pull request and may the odds be ever in your favor (they're 1 in 5, which Sheldon would remind you is better than your odds of winning a Nobel Prize).

Happy gaming, and may your rock be as dense as Sheldon's sarcasm detector, your paper as smooth as Leonard's pick-up lines, your scissors as sharp as Howard's wit, your lizard as quick as Raj after a grasshopper, and your Spock as logical as, well, Spock!
