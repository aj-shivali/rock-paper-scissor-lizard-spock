# ü™®üìÑ‚úÇÔ∏èü¶éüññ The Quantum Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Paradox

Welcome to the most intellectually stimulating and paradoxically complex-yet-simple game in the multiverse! This isn't your grandmother's Rock Paper Scissors (unless your grandmother is Schr√∂dinger's cat, in which case, how's she doing?). It's not even your nerdy cousin's Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock ‚Äì it's YOUR Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!

## What is this madness?

This Next.js application brings the age-old game of Rock Paper Scissors into the 21st century, then launches it straight into the 23rd with the Lizard Spock expansion pack. It's a game where:

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- Rock crushes Scissors

Yes, you read that right. We've added a reptile and a Vulcan to spice things up. Because why settle for three ways to lose when you can have five?

## Why should I care?

Good question! Here are a few reasons:

1. **It's a metaphor for life**: Just like in this game, in life, sometimes you're the rock, sometimes you're the paper, and sometimes you're the lizard trying to poison a Vulcan.

2. **It's quantum-entangled**: Every time you play, you're actually playing against alternate versions of yourself in five parallel universes. Or maybe it's just random. Who knows?

3. **It's a lesson in game theory**: Each choice is the best choice exactly 20% of the time. If that's not a metaphor for decision-making in the face of uncertainty, we don't know what is.

4. **It's built with Next.js and TypeScript**: Because why use simple JavaScript when you can add types to your "spock" string?

5. **It's a tribute to pop culture**: Where else can you find a game that combines prehistoric tools, office supplies, and Star Trek characters?

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository (or don't, and collapse the superposition of all possible game states across five dimensions)
2. Run `npm install` (make sure you have Node.js installed, preferably one that exists in this dimension)
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Choose your weapon wisely, for the fate of the universe (and your next 10 seconds) hangs in the balance

## Features

- **Cutting-edge randomness**: We use a state-of-the-art random number generator (Math.random()) to ensure that the computer's choices are as unpredictable as a Vulcan's emotional outburst.
- **Responsive design**: Play on your phone, tablet, or the screen of your starship (note: please don't play while navigating through an asteroid field).
- **Endless replayability**: With five whole options to choose from, the possibilities are... well, five. But they're five very exciting possibilities!
- **Educational value**: Learn about basic weapon superiority, reptile behavior, and Vulcan culture all in one game!

## The Intellectual Bit

Did you know that Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an extension of the classic game designed to reduce the chance of a tie? In game theory, this is known as a "balanced" game, where each strategy defeats and is defeated by exactly two other strategies.

The game was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, and was later popularized by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory". It's a perfect example of how adding complexity to a simple system can create new dynamics and strategies.

In terms of probability, each choice has a 20% chance of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent. This creates a more complex strategic landscape than the original game, while still maintaining perfect balance.

But let's be honest, we're not here for perfect balance. We're here to watch lizards poison Vulcans because... science?

This project is licensed under the "Live Long and Play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" License. Use at your own risk, and remember: in the game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, the only winning move is to play... or to be Spock. It's really up to you.

Happy gaming, and may your paper always be thick, your rock always be hard, your scissors always be sharp, your lizard always be poisonous, and your Spock always be logical!
